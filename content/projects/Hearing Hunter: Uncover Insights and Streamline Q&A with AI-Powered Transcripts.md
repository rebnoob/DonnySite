I built a C-Span congressional hearing transcript scraper and used it to fine-tune a GPT model to perform advanced Q&A. This project demonstrates my ability to work with large amounts of data and use machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights. This tool can help me and my organization streamline our Q&A processes and make more informed decisions based on the insights obtained.
